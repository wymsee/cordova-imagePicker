Cordova Plugin For Multiple Image Selection - implemented for iOS and Android 4.0 and above.

## Installing the plugin

The plugin conforms to the Cordova plugin specification, it can be installed using the Cordova / Phonegap command line interface.

```sh
cordova plugin add @zenput/cordova-plugin-image-picker
```


## Using the plugin

The plugin creates the object `window.imagePicker` with the method `getPictures(success, fail, options)`

Example - Get Full Size Images (all default options):
```javascript
window.imagePicker.getPictures(
	function(results) {
		for (var i = 0; i < results.length; i++) {
			console.log('Image URI: ' + results[i]);
		}
	}, function (error) {
		console.log('Error: ' + error);
	}
);
```

Example - Get at most 10 images scaled to width of 800:
```javascript
window.imagePicker.getPictures(
	function(results) {
		for (var i = 0; i < results.length; i++) {
			console.log('Image URI: ' + results[i]);
		}
	}, function (error) {
		console.log('Error: ' + error);
	}, {
		maximumImagesCount: 10,
		width: 800
	}
);
```

### Options

    options = {
        // max images to be selected, defaults to 15. If this is set to 1, upon
    	// selection of a single image, the plugin will return it.
    	maximumImagesCount: int,
    	
    	// max width and height to allow the images to be.  Will keep aspect
    	// ratio no matter what.  So if both are 800, the returned image
    	// will be at most 800 pixels wide and 800 pixels tall.  If the width is
    	// 800 and height 0 the image will be 800 pixels wide if the source
    	// is at least that wide.
    	width: int,
    	height: int,
    	
    	// quality of resized image, defaults to 100
    	quality: int (0-100)
    };
	
### iOS 10 issues

Starting from iOS 10, Apple started asking for specifying the reason for accessing the user’s photo library, therefore it's mandatory to add `NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription` entry in the info.plist.

[`NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription`](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/CocoaKeys.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40009251-SW17) describes the reason that the app accesses the user’s photo library. When the system prompts the user to allow access, this string is displayed as part of the dialog box. In order to add this entry you must pass the variable `PHOTO_LIBRARY_USAGE_DESCRIPTION` on plugin install.

Example:
 
`cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-image-picker --variable PHOTO_LIBRARY_USAGE_DESCRIPTION="your message"`

Empty string will be added as value if you dont pass the variable 
    
### Note for Android Use

The plugin returns images that are stored in a temporary directory.  These images will often not be deleted automatically though.  The files should be moved or deleted after you get their filepaths in javascript.
